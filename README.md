## Description

Due to broken starter and incomplete instructions, I was told by my SSA to submit how my code how it is. I followed the instructions and was left at a point with a multitude of errors. Github actions is connected through my deploy_hook_url from my render deploy. The cypress/front end code came broken and had instructions to not edit any other files than those specificied. Please understand I spent a lot of time trying to figure this out and couldn't. I was told to submit it how it is from my SSA, due to the instructions and starter code not being able for completion of this project without errors.
